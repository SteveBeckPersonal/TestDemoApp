# Automation Testing Application

## Purpose

This repo exists to provide an application to demonstrate Contract Testing, and Blazor Component testing.
It is a simple Blazor demo application, with a asp.net 6.0 backend which uses SQL Server and Entity Framework.

## Requirements

- Sql Server - or container
- Visual Studio

## Setup

Ensure that the SQL Connection string in the appsettings files is set correctly to your instance of SQL.
Otherwise the application should launch simply, and contract testing will work if the appsettings files are updated accordingly.
